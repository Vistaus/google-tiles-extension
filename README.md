# Google Tiles

Customize the looks and behaviour of your Google search output

* Whole search result becomes clickable and interactive (just like in DuckDuckGo)
* Make search results look and behave like cards, with configurable border radius and shadows
* Use keyboard arrow keys to navigate between results
* Add website favicons to search results, with configurable radius 
* Move actual search results on top of page, so you'll never have to scroll all way down
