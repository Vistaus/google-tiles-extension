# Google Tiles

Customize the looks and behaviour of Google search page

* Make whole search result clickable and interactive (just like in DuckDuckGo)
* Make search results look and behave like cards, with configurable border radius, shadows, colors and so on
* Capable keyboard navigation using arrow and number keys
* Add website favicons to search results 
* Move actual search results on top of page, so you'll never have to scroll all way down to find them
* Utilize horizontal screen space and scroll less by moving search widgets to the right sidebar
